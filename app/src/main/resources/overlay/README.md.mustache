# CAS Command-line Shell

To launch into the CAS command-line shell:

```bash
./gradlew[.bat] downloadShell runShell
```

# Retrieve Overlay Resources

To fetch and overlay a CAS resource or view, use:

```bash
./gradlew[.bat] getResource -PresourceName=[resource-name]
```

# Create User Interface Themes Structure

You can use the overlay to construct the correct directory structure for custom user interface themes:

```bash
./gradlew[.bat] createTheme -Ptheme=redbeard
```

The generated directory structure should match the following:

```
├── redbeard.properties
├── static
│ └── themes
│     └── redbeard
│         ├── css
│         │ └── cas.css
│         └── js
│             └── cas.js
└── templates
    └── redbeard
        └── fragments
```

HTML templates and fragments can be moved into the above directory structure, 
and the theme may be assigned to applications for use.

# List Overlay Resources
 
To list all available CAS views and templates:

```bash
./gradlew[.bat] listTemplateViews
```

To unzip and explode the CAS web application file and the internal resources jar:

```bash
./gradlew[.bat] explodeWar
```

# Configuration

- The `etc` directory contains the configuration files and directories that need to be copied to `/etc/cas/config`.

```bash
./gradlew[.bat] copyCasConfiguration
```

- The specifics of the build are controlled using the `gradle.properties` file.

## Configuration Metadata

Configuration metadata allows you to export collection of CAS properties as a report into a file 
that can later be examined. You will find a full list of CAS settings along with notes, types, default and accepted values:

```bash
./gradlew exportConfigMetadata
```
